## Quick-look notes for the datasets tried out here

### More useful
* FigureQA
  * has bar charts, but these are categorical as far as I can tell (i.e. no distributions)
  * has bounding boxes for text/bars/etc


### Less useful
* ChartAssistant
  * only has QA, no images
* ChartQAPro
  * has QA, but no bounding boxes
  * can't figure out where the figure types might be delineated
* Chart2Text
  * does not have type (like bar charts), no bounding boxes
  * does not have histograms
* ChartCheck
  * no easy way to get data
  * horizontal/vertical barcharts
  * no x/y axis labels, just QA
* OpenCQA
